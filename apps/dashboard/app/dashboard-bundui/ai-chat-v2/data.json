For instance, the `map` function allows you to transform every element of an array and return a new one. Here's a quick example:\n\n```ts\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconst squared = numbers.map(num => num * num);\n\nconsole.log(squared); // [1, 4, 9, 16]\n```\n\nThis approach is useful whenever you want to apply a transformation to each item without modifying the original array.\n\nWould you like to see an example with `filter` instead?",
