## 🏗️ Architecture Principles Established

### 1. Provider-First Organization
All third-party resources organized by provider, not by type.

### 2. Asset Library as Reference
Read-only repository for third-party code. All development in Orchestrator.

### 3. React 19 First
Mandatory React 19.x across entire monorepo via overrides.

### 4. 9-Language Support
All components must support: en, es, ar, zh, fr, pt, de, ja, hi

### 5. Documentation Coherence
Single source of truth for each topic. No duplicates. Cross-referenced.

## 🎯 Next Steps (When Asset Library Copy Completes)

### Immediate
1. [ ] Run reorganization script (shadcnblocks, vercel-ai-sdk, etc.)
2. [ ] Verify Asset Library structure
3. [ ] Create SYNC_STATUS.md for each provider
4. [ ] Commit and push Asset Library

### Short Term
1. [ ] Populate Asset Library with reference code
2. [ ] Document existing integrations in SYNC_STATUS files
3. [ ] Share Asset Library URL with Developer 2
4. [ ] Create onboarding guide for Developer 2

### Medium Term (Before Phase 1)
1. [ ] Audit all existing third-party components
2. [ ] Run QA checklist on each
3. [ ] Document all in Asset Library
4. [ ] Ensure 100% i18n compliance

## 👥 Team Structure

### Roles
- **mescallo-arquitecto** (You): Architecture, standards, quality
- **mescallo-developer-2**: Implementation, validation, testing

### Workflow
1. Arquitecto defines standards and structure
2. Developer 2 implements following standards
3. Arquitecto reviews and approves
4. Both maintain documentation

### Core
- React 19.0.0 (enforced via overrides)
- Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS

### State & Data
- React hooks (no Redux)
- Server Components where applicable
- No database (Phase 0)

### i18n

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (Phase 0)

### What Worked
1. ✅ Organizing BEFORE database integration
2. ✅ Provider-First principle (scalable)
3. ✅ React 19 overrides (solved Dual React)
4. ✅ Master Index (single source of truth)

### What to Maintain
1. ✅ Document EVERYTHING before coding
2. ✅ Eliminate duplicates immediately
3. ✅ Use Asset Library for reference only
4. ✅ Manual review for third-party updates

---

## 🔐 Quality Gates (Before Phase 1)

### Must Complete
- [ ] All third-party components documented in Asset Library
- [ ] All components pass QA checklist
- [ ] 100% i18n compliance (9 languages)
- [ ] All SYNC_STATUS files created
- [ ] Developer 2 onboarded and trained

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Automated i18n compliance checker
- [ ] Component usage analytics
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
