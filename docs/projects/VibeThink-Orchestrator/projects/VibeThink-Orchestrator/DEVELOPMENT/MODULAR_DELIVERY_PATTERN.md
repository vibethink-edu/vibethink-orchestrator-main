# Modular Delivery Pattern for New Modules

## Description
This pattern defines the workflow, milestones, and standard documentation for delivering any new module in the platform. It ensures traceability, quality, agile onboarding, and continuous improvement.

---

## Steps/Milestones of the Pattern
1. **Module design and creation**
   - Define objective, scope, and success criteria.
2. **Milestone 1:** First visible prototype in UI/backend.
3. **Milestone 2:** Complete integration and main functionality operational.
4. **Milestone 3:** Visual feedback, validations, and user experience.
5. **Milestone 4:** Manual testing and test file registration.
6. **Milestone 5:** Technical and functional documentation:
   - What has been done and how it works.
   - Limitations and recommendations.
   - Pending improvements and backlog for next sprints.
   - Usage examples and best practices.

## Checklist for each module
- [ ] Objective and scope defined
- [ ] Visible and tested prototype
- [ ] Backend/frontend integration ready
- [ ] Feedback and validations implemented
- [ ] Manual tests registered
- [ ] Exhaustive documentation generated
- [ ] Improvements and backlog documented

---

## Applied Example: Pending Dashboard
- **Functionality:** Pending control, inline editing, saving, filters, test registration.
- **Documentation:**
  - docs/stakeholders/FAQS_PENDIENTES.md
  - docs/stakeholders/PRUEBAS_PENDIENTES.md
  - docs/development/SHADCN_UI_INTEGRATION.md
  - docs/development/MODULAR_DELIVERY_PATTERN.md (this file)
- **Improvement backlog:** Test automation, AI integration, collaborative editing, etc.

---

## Recommendations
- Follow this pattern for all new modules (UI, backend, integrations, etc.).
- Adapt milestones according to module nature.
- Keep documentation alive and versioned.
- Review and update checklist in each sprint.
