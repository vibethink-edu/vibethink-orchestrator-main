## Billing Strategy: Roles and Departmental Scopes

- Pricing is based on the number and type of roles, not the number of departments/scopes.
- Segmented management by departments/areas/projects is included in enterprise plans, or as a premium add-on in basic plans.
- The client decides how many scopes to create and how to assign roles and permissions.
- Users only see and manage information within their scope.
- Scalable, flexible, and transparent model.

**Commercial message:**
"With VTK, you only pay for the roles and capabilities you need. Department/area management is included, and you decide how to organize and assign permissions in your company."
