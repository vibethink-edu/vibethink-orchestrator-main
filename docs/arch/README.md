# Architecture Documentation Index (`docs/arch/`)

This directory contains the **Canonical Architecture** of ViTo. These documents represent sealed principles and foundational patterns that govern the entire platform.

## 🗂️ Core Principles

- **[CORE_VITO_ARCHITECTURE.md](./CORE_VITO_ARCHITECTURE.md)**: The foundational four pillars: Multi-Entity, Multi-Jurisdiction, Context-First, and Domain-Agnostic.

## 🧭 Roadmap of Pillars

1. **[Pillar I: Multi-Entity](./PILAR_I_MULTI_ENTITY.md)** (Pending)
   - Identity hierarchy and ownership models.
2. **[Pillar II: Multi-Jurisdiction](./PILAR_II_REGIONAL.md)** (Pending)
   - Localization, Timezone Safety, and Regional Compliance.
3. **[Pillar III: Context-First](./PILAR_III_CONTEXT.md)** (Pending)
   - Logic driven by Product and Resource contexts.
4. **[Pillar IV: Domain-Agnostic](./PILAR_IV_DOMAIN_PACKS.md)** (Pending)
   - The Core + Domain Packs extension model.

## ⚠️ Governance

- **Source of Truth**: These documents are the final authority.
- **Modification**: Any change requires a formal Architectural Review and must be updated here before implementation.
- **Reference**: Technical implementations (`docs/architecture/`) and models (`docs/canon/`) must strictly adhere to these principles.
