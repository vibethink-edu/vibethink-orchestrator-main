# ViTo Runtime Layer Canon v1.0

## Purpose

The Runtime Layer Canon defines the canonical runtime primitives, contracts, and processes that govern the ViTo Reasoning Runtime. It exists to ensure that all runtime components are deterministic, verifiable, and consistent with the Core Canon, providing a stable foundation for Specialists and Orchestrators to operate upon.

## Hierarchy of Canons

The ViTo documentation follows a strict hierarchy:

Core Canon (intocable) → Runtime Primitives (Runtime Layer) → Readiness Checklist → Amendment Process

## Runtime Certification

An implementation of the ViTo runtime is certified by executing the full `RUNTIME_READINESS_CHECKLIST_V1.md`. The final output of this certification is a binary **PASSED/FAILED** verdict.

**No exceptions by slice.**
