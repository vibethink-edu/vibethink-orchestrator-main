## Overview

ViTo follows a **Core + Domain Packs** architecture:

- **Core**: Domain-agnostic platform (multi-tenant, timeline, permissions, i18n)
- **Domain Packs**: Vertical-specific vocabulary and business rules (hotel, studio, cowork, etc.)

This separation ensures:
1. Core remains reusable across all verticals
2. Domain expertise is encapsulated in packs
3. New verticals can be added without modifying core
