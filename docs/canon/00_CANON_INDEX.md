## What is Canon?

**Canon** = Irrefutable architectural truth for VibeThink Orchestrator (ViTo).

Canon documents define:
- **What ViTo IS** (foundational architecture, not features)
- **What is allowed to claim** (with FIT gates validation)
- **What is prohibited to claim** (until gates pass)
- **Invariants** (rules that never change)
